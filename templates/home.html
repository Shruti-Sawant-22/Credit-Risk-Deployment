            <h3>Credit Risk : </h3>

            <br>

            <p>Credit risk is nothing but the default in payment of any loan by the borrower. 
                In Banking sector this is an important factor to be considered before approving 
                the loan of an applicant.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact of Credit Risk :</h3>

            <br>

            <p>
                The bankâ€™s revenue pattern depends on the saving account and loans they offer. 
                Once an account holder puts money in their saving account, they get certain 
                interest on their account balance. The bank keeps some part of these balances in 
                reserve to make payments in case of withdrawals. The rest of the money is given
                as loans to borrowers. The interest put on loan is the revenue earned by the banks.
            </p>

            <p>Taking into consideration the factors that will decide whether a person will pay 
               back the loan or not is crucial for banks. This is a common credit risk problem 
               which is solved using analytics.
            
            <p>While receiving application of a borrower, the bank asks certain details about the 
              applicant. The general factors that help predict loan default are income, occupation,
              age, loan amount etc of the applicant.
            </p>
